# AirBnB Clone - The Console

This is the first step towards building a complete web application: the **AirBnB clone**. In this initial phase, we are developing a **command-line interpreter** (CLI) to manage the backend objects of the application.

## Ì≥å Project Description

The goal of this project is to build a command interpreter that allows us to:

- Create and manage different objects like `User`, `Place`, `City`, etc.
- Store and retrieve these objects via a JSON-based file storage system.
- Prepare the base for a larger application involving front-end and database integration.

## Ì∑† Key Concepts

- Python OOP
- Serialization/Deserialization using JSON
- File storage engine
- Command-line interface using `cmd` module
- Unit testing using `unittest`
- UUIDs and datetime handling
- Python packaging and documentation standards

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Start the Console

You can start the console in **interactive mode**:

```bash
$ ./console.py
(hbnb)
